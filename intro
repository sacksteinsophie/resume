Hello all! I’m excited to start my second semester at Hopkins. I taking this course because most of my work and interests revolve around machine learning and data analysis, and I've never taken a higher level class in statistical methods, so I'd like to close some gaps in my understanding. I’m an ML Engineer working for a Government Contracting Agency at the Department of Defense. I worked before as a researcher, particularly looking into rules-based NLP models for blocksworld and a ULF project (worked under Len Schubert and James Allen at Univ of Rochester). I’ve published a few articles about linguistic concept learning (particularly number concepts in language without any base/multiplicative number system, like Tsimane) and semantic representation, which are available online in ACL Anthology and Wiley Online (as well as PNAS, soon!). I studied the Tsimane number concept in Bolivia for a year and other number systems in isolated populations. I can’t wait to be back in school, and all of you seem like extraordinary, fun and smart classmates/professors! On a more fun note, I’ll stop the run-on sentence resume and switch over to some personal info. I am currently working on teaching my Jetson Nano bot to follow our cat and play baby shark when in range. I like to paint large-scale oil paintings of memes, I made a panzer of the lake and baby yoda painting (acrylic) this month and I’ll soon be working on my Bernie painting. :)
